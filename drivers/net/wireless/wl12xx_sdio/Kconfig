menuconfig WL12XX_MENU
	tristate "TI wl12xx driver support"
	---help---
	  This will enable TI wl12xx driver support for the following chips:
	  wl1271, wl1273, wl1281 and wl1283.
	  The drivers make use of the mac80211 stack.

	select FW_LOADER
	---help---
	  This module adds support for wireless adapters based on TI wl1271 and
	  TI wl1273 chipsets. This module does *not* include support for wl1251.
	  For wl1251 support, use the separate homonymous driver instead.

	  If you choose to build a module, it will be called wl12xx. Say N if
	  unsure.

config WL12XX_SPI

	depends on WL12XX && SPI_MASTER
	select CRC7
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the SPI interface of adapters using
	  TI wl12xx chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the SPI bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called wl12xx_spi.
	  Say N if unsure.

config WL12XX_SDIO
	tristate "TI wl12xx SDIO support"
	depends on WL12XX && MMC
	---help---
	  This module adds support for the SDIO interface of adapters using
	  TI wl12xx chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the SDIO bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called wl12xx_sdio.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NL80211_TESTMODE
	bool "nl80211 testmode command"
	depends on WL12XX_SDIO
	help
	  The nl80211 testmode command helps implementing things like
	  factory calibration or validation tools for wireless chips.

	  Select this option ONLY for kernels that are specifically
	  built for such purposes.

	  Debugging tools that are supposed to end up in the hands of
	  users should better be implemented with debugfs.

	  Say N.
